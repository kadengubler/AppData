Product Requirements Document (PRD) for CA-Okta Integration
1. Objective
To enable seamless integration between the Configuration Automation tool (CA) and Okta for efficient identity and access management across the organization.

2. Background
The integration aims to automate the provisioning, deprovisioning, and updating of user access across systems managed by CA, leveraging Okta's identity management capabilities.

3. Scope
User Provisioning: Automatically create, update, and deactivate user accounts in CA-managed systems based on changes in Okta.
Access Management: Synchronize user roles and permissions between CA and Okta to ensure consistent access controls.
Single Sign-On (SSO): Enable users to access CA-managed systems through Okta's SSO capabilities.
Audit and Compliance: Support auditing and compliance requirements by providing detailed logs of user access and changes.
4. Requirements
Functional Requirements:
FR1: The integration must support real-time synchronization between CA and Okta.
FR2: User attributes (e.g., name, email, roles) must be accurately mapped between both systems.
FR3: The system must support bulk operations for user provisioning and deprovisioning.
FR4: Provide a user-friendly interface for mapping roles and permissions between CA and Okta.
Non-Functional Requirements:
NFR1: Ensure the security of data transmission between CA and Okta.
NFR2: The integration should be scalable to support a growing number of users and systems.
NFR3: Minimize the impact on system performance during synchronization operations.
5. Assumptions
The organization has active subscriptions to both CA and Okta.
Users have unique identifiers that are consistent across both platforms.
6. Out of Scope
Custom development outside the predefined user provisioning and deprovisioning workflows.
Integration with third-party systems not managed by CA.
7. Stakeholders
IT Administrators
Security Team
End Users
8. Timeline
Project Kick-off: [Date]
Requirements Finalization: [Date]
Development Start: [Date]
Testing Phase: [Date]
Go-Live: [Date]
9. Risks and Mitigations
Risk 1: Data mismatch between CA and Okta could lead to access issues.
Mitigation: Implement robust data validation and error handling mechanisms.
Risk 2: Downtime during integration could affect user access.
Mitigation: Plan integration activities during off-peak hours and provide clear communication to users.

**User Story: Audit and Compliance Logging**

As an IT compliance officer, I want the integration to provide detailed logs of user access and changes, So that we can support auditing and compliance requirements efficiently.

---

**User Story: Real-Time Synchronization**

As an IT administrator, I want the integration to support real-time synchronization between CA and Okta, So that any changes in user status or roles are immediately reflected in both systems.

---

**User Story: Accurate User Attributes Mapping**

As an IT administrator, I want user attributes such as name, email, and roles to be accurately mapped between CA and Okta, So that user information remains consistent and reliable across both platforms.

---
